# Energy_consumption_prediction

***Description***
Developed a machine learning model to predict electricity consumption based on building metadata, historical usage, and weather data. The project utilized a dataset of 698,675 samples with 15 features, providing actionable insights for energy efficiency and sustainability.


***Key Contributions***<br>
•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand consumption behaviour and identify trends.<br>
•	Pre-processed data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.<br>
•	Engineered features to improve model performance, including weather-related variables and temporal factors.<br>
•	Trained and evaluated regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), achieving a high R² score for accuracy.<br>
•	Deployed a Streamlit application for real-time predictions, enabling dynamic forecasting for users.<br>
